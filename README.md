Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local data.json file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the .html file.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
